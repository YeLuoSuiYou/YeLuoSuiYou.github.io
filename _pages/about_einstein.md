Hi, I'm Zilyu, a third-year undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence at South China University of Technology. Currently, I'm interning with [Bytedance Seed Vision Team](https://team.doubao.com/en/), where I focus on visual generation post-training. Prior to this, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Prof. Qi Liu](https://drliuqi.github.io/) and [Prof. Guo-Jun Qi](http://maple-lab.net/about.html).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
