Hi, I'm Zilyu, a third-year undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence at South China University of Technology. Currently, I'm interning with [Bytedance Seed Vision Team](https://team.doubao.com/en/), where I focus on visual generation post-training. Prior to this, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Prof. Qi Liu](https://drliuqi.github.io/) and [Prof. Guo-Jun Qi](https://maple.lab.westlake.edu.cn/index.htm).
